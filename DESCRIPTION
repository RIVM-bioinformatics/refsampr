Description: At the RIVM, we use the Juno_pipeline (https://github.com/AleSR13/Juno_pipeline)
    to do pre-processing and de novo assembly of bacterial isolates. Since 2020, we have also
    included a set of reference samples that let us monitor the quality of the data produced
    by the NGS sequencing facility. This package helps generating quality control (QC) reports
    for monitoring the quality of our data.
